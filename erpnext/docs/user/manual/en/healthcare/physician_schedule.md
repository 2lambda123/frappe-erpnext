# Physician Schedule
Physician Schedule will help you to configure the availability and work hours of Physicians. You can then select an applicable schedule for each Physician.

You can create Physician Schedule from -
> Healthcare > Masters > Physician Schedule

After naming the schedule you can use the "Add Time Slots" button to create time slots for each day of the week. These time slots will then be displayed while checking the availability of a Physician when booking an Appointment.
