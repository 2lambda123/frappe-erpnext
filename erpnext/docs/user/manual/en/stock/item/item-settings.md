### Clean HTML Description

Usually descriptions are copy-pasted from a website or Word / PDF file and they contain a lot of embedded style. This messes up the Print view of your invoices or quotes.

To fix this, you can check "Convert Item Description to Clean HTML" in Item Settings. This will ensure that when you save your Items, their descriptions will be cleaned up.

If you want control your description views and llow any HTML to be embedded, you can uncheck this property.
