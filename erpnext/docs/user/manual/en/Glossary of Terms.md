this is a stubb !

The intention is to build a Glossary of terms (i.e. site, Form view, etc.) and what they exactly mean in the logic of ERPNext

**Site** - [add definition here]

**Like** (in Filter to filter list items) - same meaning as "Contains" (i.e you put in term 'SIN' the filter will find Sales Invoices (SINV). "Like" has no ability to find misstypoed terms like finding tasks, when searching for 'taks'

**Filter** - [add definition here]
