You can track payables through Purchase Invoice and process Payment Entries against it.\n\nPurchase Invoices can also be created against a Purchase Order or Purchase Receipt. Purchase Invoice is the exact opposite of your Sales Invoice.\n\n\n![Purchase Flow](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/assets/img/accounts/pi-flow.png)\n\n",
